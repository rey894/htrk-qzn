## Organizing Media

### File Naming

Use descriptive file names:

- ❌ Bad: `IMG_1234.jpg`

### Alt Text Guidelines

Alt text should describe the image:
- ✅ Good: "Municipality of Quezon official seal with green, gold, and brown colors"
- ❌ Bad: "Image" or "Logo"

### Description Guidelines

Use descriptions for additional context:
- Date taken
- Location
- Event or context
- Any relevant details

## Image Optimization Tips

### Before Uploading

1. **Resize Images**: Use appropriate dimensions (don't upload 4000px images if only 800px needed)
2. **Compress Images**: Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to reduce file size
3. **Choose Right Format**: Use JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, WebP when supported

### Recommended Dimensions

- **Hero Images**: 1920x1080px (16:9 ratio)
- **Featured Images**: 1200x630px (Facebook Open Graph)

- **Icons**: 512x512px or 256x256px (square)

## Accessibility Requirements

### Alt Text Requirements

- **Always required** for images
- Should describe the image content
- Be concise but descriptive
- Avoid redundant phrases like "Image of" or "Picture of"

### Example Alt Text

- **Logo**: "Municipality of Quezon official seal"
- **People**: "Mayor Pablo M. Lorenzo III addressing constituents"
- **Places**: "Quezon Municipal Hall main entrance"
- **Events**: "Quezon Agricultural Festival 2025 parade"
